        <p class="user">Orarius</p>
        <p class="reason">Orarius helped me sketch up designs for a new verion of iFakku. They were so pretty they basically motivated to improve on the UI of the old iFakku. He also provided some awesome icons.</p>
        <p class="user">Icertys</p>
        <p class="reason">Icertys handled early distribution of the app on Cydia which really helped the app gain exposure. He also created some vital backends that allowed this app to interact with the User Favorites page. He was also involved in the debugging on the beta versions of iFakku.</p>
        <p class="user">icons8</p>
        <p class="reason">Most icons are used from icons8.</p>
        <p class="user">Jacob and the rest of the Fakku staff</p>
        <p class="reason">Needless to say, the only reason this app exists is due to all the hard work Jacob and the rest of the Fakku staff put into the website and into the API.</p>
        <p class="user">And You</p>
        <p class="reason">For using this app.</p>
