        <p class="question">What is my "full username"?</p>
        <p class="answer">To find your "full username", go to your profile on the Fakku website and look at the URL. For my profile, this is the URL &lt;https://www.fakku.net/users/trueyukinagato-3357829&gt;. Your full username is the last segment of the URL, in my case, it would be &lt;trueyukinagato-3357829&gt; without the greater than/less than characters. If you are an older user, your full username may not contain an id number.</p>
        
        <p class="question">Is iFakku free?</p>
        <p class="answer">iFakku is 100% free and ad-free. I have no plans to use iFakku for monetization purposes.</p>
        
        <p class="question">Will iFakku be open source?</p>
        <p class="answer">I plan to release the source code for iFakku at some point. I don't know when this will be. You should just know that the code is an absolute mess. </p>
        
        <p class="question">I found a bug/have a suggestion, how do I contact you about it?</p>
        <p class="answer">The best way to get in touch with me is through the Fakku website itself. Just post your suggestion or bug onto the official iFakku thread under Forums > FAKKU Developers. I'm also on the Fakku IRC a lot under the handle TYN, so you can chat with me there as well.</p>
        
        <p class="question">Any usage recommendations when using the app?</p>
        <p class="answer">Alright, so a lot of pages are reused, so there's a lot of checking code. My only suggestion is to view Downloaded manga from the Downloaded tabs since the images are loaded internally, and thus, much faster.</p>
        
        <p class="question">What are the "Fakku Forums" and "Official iFakku Thread" buttons on the User page?</p>
        <p class="answer">I just put those there to make it easier to get to the forums. They're simply web views displaying the respective pages. Obviously, if you think I'm out to steal your password because I somehow rigged the web view (I didn't), don't use it. I lurk the forums a lot.</p>
        
        <p class="question">Version 3.0? What happened to Version 2.0?</p>
        <p class="answer">So I was programming version 2.0, but then I was super preoccupied with real life, so development stopped for many months. A lot of the code in iFakku 2.0 was also very experimental, so when I tried to start development again, I would just get too confused and stop. iFakku 3.0 is a fresh version of iFakku that refined the code in iFakku 2.0 and I feel it warrants a new version.</p>
        
        <p class="question">Who are you?</p>
        <p class="answer">Just a user on Fakku, not even a prominent one at that. I used to have an Android phone and I loved the Fakku app for it (this was before the API came out) and was always disappointed that there wasn't an equivalent on iOS.</p>
        
        <p class="question">How long did it take you to program the app?</p>
        <p class="answer">Funny story, I actually only adequately learned iOS programming a week before the Fakku API came out. It took me about 3 weeks to complete a decent app. I've been really busy.</p>
        
        <p class="question">How do I donate?</p>
        <p class="answer">Thank you for the consideration, but iFakku doesn't need funding. However, if you'd still like to show your appreciation, please consider posting a simple "Thanks" on the Official iFakku Thread on the Fakku Forums. If that's still not enough to express your appreciation (:, I'd love a (digital) copy of any of the Fakku Books (for various reasons, I can't get one ATM). There is a gifting option <a href="https://www.fakku.net/users/trueyukinagato-3357829/books">here</a>. Thank you so much (:</p>
